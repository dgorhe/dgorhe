### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Darvesh Gorhe and I'm currently a Staff Associate II in the Jovanovic Lab at Columbia University. The lab focuses on proteomics and systems biology questions using tools like immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-MS), and phospho-enriched mass spectrometry. I'm the primary bioinformatics person in the lab so I help with data analysis, automated pipelines (Snakemake, nextflow, etc), utilizing Columbia's high performance computing (HPC) resources, and software development for the lab. You can learn more about the lab [here](https://jovanoviclab.com/).

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several things. A lot of my day job stuff is private because it's either pending publication or in a nascent phase of research. Apart from that I'm working on a mobile app called Literacy Pathways and a maps website called folsommaps.com.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of React, TypeScript, and JavaScript for the mobile app and folsommaps.com. However I just started reading a book on `sed` and `awk` (ISBN: 9781565922259) and it's been a very fun read so far! I saw myself dealing with large genomics text files for work and thought it might be useful to move past `grep`.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/his because I could never be him ðŸ˜”
